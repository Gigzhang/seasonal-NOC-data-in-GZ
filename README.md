The data used in the publication is separated into 2 .csv files in a zip file.

One file contains the temporal variations of relative peak areas and detected number of various species measured by the SPAMS, and also the meteorological parameters related in the presented study. A detailed description of each column was also included in the .CSV file. NA means no available data in that hour, or the particle number detected by the SPAMS was lower than 50.

The other file contains the average mass spectrum data for the measured NOCs-containing particles.
